# Fiber_Routineandchannel
This is my repo about go routine and channel in golang concurrency using fiber web framework

Hey, this is my repo about go routine and channel in fiber.

i wanted to learn concurrency for learning to modify things.

well i cant make things better if i cant see its potential for modification.

i just like modifying things.

By the way, concurrency is just multitasking in programming language terms.

go routines are the same as async and threads.

lets just say that go routines are like an entire employee team in a shop.

one in a counter, one would be sending the food to customer, one would be making the food,etc.

well if you want to know more about it another example is just imagine having 3 monitors at once with only one cpu connected to each other.

1 monitor for gaming, 1 monitor for chat and the last monitor is for coding.

Channels are just like power cords in cellphone chargers. 

channels are just like connectors
